// GraphView provides the configuration for what is included in the service graph response.
//
// The flows are aggregated based on the layers and expanded nodes defined in this view. The graph is then pruned
// based on the focus and followed-nodes. A graph node is included if any of the following is true:
//   - the node (or one of its child nodes) is in-focus
//   - the node (or one of its child nodes) is connected directly to an in-focus node (in either connection Direction)
//   - the node (or one of its child nodes) is connected indirectly to an in-focus node, respecting the Direction
//     of the connection and FollowConnectionDirection is true (*)
//   - the node (or one of its child nodes) is directly connected to an "included" node whose connections are being
//     explicitly "followed" in the appropriate connection Direction via FollowedEgress or FollowedIngress params (*)
//
// (*) Suppose you have nodes A, B, C, D, E; C is directly in focus
//
//	If connections are: A-->B-->C-->D-->E then: B, C and D will be included by default.
//	                                            A, B, C, D and E will all be included if FollowConnectionDirection is true
//	If connections are: A<--B-->C-->D<--E then: B, C and D will be included in the view, and
//	                                            A will be included iff the egress connections for B are being followed
//	                                            E will be included iff the ingress connections for D are being followed
