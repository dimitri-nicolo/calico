# PacketCapture Download API

PacketCapture Download API exposes the API to retrieve pcap files generated by a PacketCapture. This enables personas
like DevOps or Platform Engineers to retrieve files backed by a namespace RBAC.  

Sample call to retrieve files for management or standalone cluster:
```
kubectl port-forward -ntigera-manager service/tigera-manager 9443:9443 &
NS=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NS> NAME=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NAME> TOKEN=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN> \
curl "https://localhost:9443/packet-capture/download/$NS/$NAME/files.zip" \
-H "Authorizaton: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-O -L
```

Sample call to delete files for management or standalone cluster:
```
kubectl port-forward -ntigera-manager service/tigera-manager 9443:9443 &
NS=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NS> NAME=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NAME> TOKEN=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN> \
curl -X DELETE "https://localhost:9443/packet-capture/files/$NS/$NAME" \
-H "Authorizaton: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Files from a managed cluster can be retrieved via the management cluster:

```
kubectl port-forward -ntigera-manager service/tigera-manager 9443:9443 &
NS=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NS> NAME=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NAME> TOKEN=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN> CLUSTER=<REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER> \
curl 'https://localhost:9443/packet-capture/download/$NS/$NAME/files.zip \
-H "Authorizaton: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "X-CLUSTER-ID: $CLUSTER" \
-O -L
```

A request like above will retrieve all the generated pcap files at the moment of download as a zip archive.

Files from a managed cluster can be deleted via the management cluster:

```
kubectl port-forward -ntigera-manager service/tigera-manager 9443:9443 &
NS=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NS> NAME=<REPLACE_WITH_PACKETCAPTURE_NAME> TOKEN=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN> CLUSTER=<REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER> \
curl -X DELETE 'https://localhost:9443/packet-capture/files/$NS/$NAME \
-H "Authorizaton: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "X-CLUSTER-ID: $CLUSTER"
```

In order to allow access to this API, a role like the following needs to be applied in a K8s cluster:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: tigera-authentication-clusterrole
rules:
- apiGroups: ["projectcalico.org"]
  resources: ["authenticationreviews"]
  verbs: ["create"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: sample
  name: tigera-capture-files-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["projectcalico.org"]
  resources: ["packetcaptures/files"]
  verbs: ["get", "delete"]
```

For MCM setup, all users need to have `CREATE` for `authenticationreviews` inside the management cluster. In addition, 
`GET`, `DELETE` access for `packetcaptures/files` is needed for clusters where the packet capture was created.   

## Calico Enterprise

PacketCapture API is an HTTP service backed by the tigera-packetcapture service and deployment. By default, it is
installed by Tigera operator. This service will be deployed for all cluster types, and requests
will be routed in accordance to the routing rules in voltron and guardian. 

Voltron and Guardian containers have a route defined for any requests that starts with `/packet-capture/` prefix. It will strip away that 
prefix and forward it to the tigera-packetcapture service.

For a multicluster setup, Voltron will proxy a call to the managed cluster that starts with `/packet-capture/` and header `X-CLUSTER-ID`. This
request will be sent to Guardian, via the tunnel. Guardian will proxy this request to the PacketCapture
API, after it strips away the prefix.

## Building and testing

In order to build the API locally, use one of the following commands:

```
make image
```

or

```
make ci cd
```

Testing this API on a local environment is currently not possible as it has dependency to run in an K8S environment
with Calico Enterprise installed.

In order to run local tests, use the following command:

```
make ut
```

This API makes use of tigera-packetcapture service account and requires the following permissions:
- GET for api group `projectcalico.org` for resource `packetcaptures`
- CREATE for api group `projectcalico.org` for resource `authenticationreviews`
- LIST for core v1 group for resource `pods` in namespace tigera-fluentd
- CREATE for core v1 group for subresource `pods/exec` in namespace tigera-fluentd
- CREATE for api group `authorization.k8s.io` for resource `subjectaccessreviews`
